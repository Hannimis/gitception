                    <ol>
                        <li>In the terminal we opened, type pwd, this will Print the Working Directory. Thus pwd.</li>
                        <li>It should return something like /c/ or /p/, this is the root of your current disk.</li>
                        <li>If you have the same problem as I, and is in the wrong disk, do "cd /c/" to change to the c drive.</li>
                        <li>From here we can navigate through our directories using "ls" and "cd".
                            <ul>
                            <li>ls shows all the files and folders in your current directory.</li>
                            <li>cd changes into a new directory or backwards. cd directoryname will change into that directory, and that will be your new "working directory". cd .. will go up one level, cd / will return to the root of the drive. </li>
                            <li>pwd does what it says. Prints the current Working Directory. In human terms, it shows you the path to where you're currently located as in desktop or music etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>When you're located at where you wish to make a folder dedicated to git, type in git init, this will initialize git. You NEED to do this in order for git to work. When you've done this, a folder might or might not appear, depends if you have show hidden folders enabled.</li>
                        <li>Do your thing, make a website or whatever, when you feel like you want to save your <span>shit</span> stuff, type in git status, this will now show a list of stuff git doesn't track (yet). If you do this in a empty folder, it will most likely print, "up to date" or something similiar.</li>
                        <li>Great, now you can navigate and initialize git. Next up is staging and committing.</li>
